# 1. Import Images

# Ensure 'refDat.tiff' and 'rawDat.tiff' are in the same directory as your Python script
# or provide their full paths.

    # Mathematica often treats image data as numbers directly.
    # Ensure they are float and, if they are intensity images, they might need
    # to be converted to complex if they represent complex-valued holograms.
    # Assuming they are intensity images (real values) initially, we'll convert them to complex
    # as the Fresnel transform operates on complex fields.

    exit()

# Get image dimensions (assuming both images have the same dimensions)
size_x, size_y = ref_image.shape

# 2. Perform calculations (corresponds to 'con' in Mathematica)
# The 'con' variable in Mathematica: rawImage / refImage^2
# This is element-wise division.

# 3. Apply Fresnel transform and display result

# Optional: Save the reconstructed image
# cv2.imwrite("reconstructed_image.tiff", reconstructed_image.astype(np.float32))
# Note: Saving complex data or displaying specific magnitudes might require careful handling
# of data types and normalization if the values are outside typical image ranges (0-255).
# Here, we're displaying the absolute square, which is intensity, so a grayscale map is appropriate.
